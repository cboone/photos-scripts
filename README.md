# Photography scripts

## Workflow

NB: Path context is `~/Pictures/Photographs`.

1. I insert "Untitled" card with X-T5 raw photos
2. On mount, Chronosync copies all new photos from the card to `./Importing`
3. Then runs `finalize-x-t5-card-sync-chronosync-wrapper`
4. Which runs `finalize-x-t5-card-sync` with timestamped logging to `./Scripts/logs` (which can be viewed using `less-log` or `tail-log`)
   1. Which runs `backup-new-imports` which uses `exiftool` to
      1. Copy all photos in `Importing/` to `Originals/YYYY/YY-MM-DD/` (using the photo creation date)
      2. Create a structured log of all backed up photos in `Logs/YYYY/YYYYmmddTHHMMSS-imported.csv` (using today's date in ISO 8601-ish format)
   2. Then runs `update-new-imports-metadata` which uses `exiftool` to
      1. Update the copyright metadata to standard values
      2. Update the exposure metadata to remove existing adjustments and set a linear (gamma 2.2) contrast curve, to create a flat-toned photo
      3. Update the lens metadata, iff the lens used (per file) appears to have been a manual lens without exif data (the Laowa 10mm)
      4. Copy all metadata from the RAF file to an XMP sidecar file
   3. Then runs `move-and-rename-newly-imported-photos` which uses `exiftool` to
      1. Move the photos to `Ready for Review/YYYY-MM-DD-FILENAME.{RAF,xmp}` (using the photo creation date)
      2. Create a structured log of all imported photos in `Logs/YYYY/YYYYmmddTHHMMSS-renamed.csv` (using today's date in ISO 8601-ish format)
   4. Then runs `open-new-imports-for-review`
      1. Which opens `Ready for Review/` in FastRawViewer
         1. In which I review the photos by
            1. Marking selects with >= 1 star
            2. Marking rejects with -1 star
   5. Then runs `unmount-card` (without waiting for the manual review process)
   6. After reviewing the photos in FRV, I run `finish-review`
      1. Which runs `trash-rejected-photos` which uses `exiftool` to
         1. Find all photos with -1 stars in `Ready to review/`
         2. Pass them to `trash` for soft deletion
         3. Create a CSV log of all rejected photo filenames in `Logs/YYYY/YYYYmmddTHHMMSS-rejected.csv` (using today's date)
      2. Then runs `move-selected-photos`
         1. Which uses `exiftool` to
            1. Find all photos with â‰¥ 1 star in `Ready to review/`
            2. Move them (and their sidecars) to `YYYY/` (using the photo creation date)
            3. Create a CSV log of all selected photos in `Logs/YYYY/YYYYmmddTHHMMSS-selected.csv` (using today's date)
      3. Then runs `import-selected-photos-into-lightroom` which
         1. Opens, using the CSV log (parsed by `qsv`), the selected photos and their sidecars in Adobe Lightroom Classic
         2. Waits for me to "press any key", which I do after
            1. I import the photos into the local Lightroom catalog
            2. And mark them for syncing to the Lightroom cloud, via adding them to a synced collection
         3. Opens, using the CSV log (parsed by `qsv`), the selected photos and their sidecars in Adobe Lightroom CC
         4. Waits for me to "press any key", which I do after
            1. I import the photos into the Lightroom Cloud (again), so as replace the Smart Previews generated by Lightroom Classic with the real RAF files
      4. Then runs `move-reviewed-photos` which uses `exiftool` to
         1. Move all remaining files (RAF and xmp) from `Ready to review/` to `YYYY/` (using the photo creation date)
         2. Create a CSV log of all reviewed (but not selected or rejected) photos in `Logs/YYYY/YYYYmmddTHHMMSS-reviewed.csv` (using today's date)

### Structured log format

NB: Dates in photo filenames are the date of photo creation. Dates in log filenames are the current date (the date the script was run).

#### 1. Imported

`Logs/YYYY/YYYYmmddTHHMMSS-imported.csv`

|Original filename|Path to backed up original|
|-|-|
|DSCF2859.RAF|Originals/2023/2023-01-24/DSCF2859.RAF|

#### 2. Renamed

`Logs/YYYY/YYYYmmddTHHMMSS-renamed.csv`

|Original filename|Updated filename|Sidecar filename|
|-|-|-|
|DSCF2859.RAF|20230124-DSCF2859.RAF|20230124-DSCF2859.xmp|

#### Reviewed

`Logs/YYYY/YYYYmmddTHHMMSS-reviewed.csv`

|Path to file|Path to sidecar|
